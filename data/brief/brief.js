    briefPreview: `Public Accountability Committees in many countries have  been effective in their work for a long time. The general  understanding of these committees can be based on their  key terms; &apos;public&apos; and &apos;accountability&apos;. Public Accountability  Committees enhance high levels of competence, reliability,  and honesty in public sectors (O&apos;Regan et.al., 2022).  Africa is one of the continents that has profoundly utilized  Public Accountability Committees, especially in the financial  management and regulation of service delivery. Historically, the  modern Public Accountability Committee can be traced back  to 1861 in the United Kingdom when its government raised  concerns about examining its expenditures in all departments  associated with the management of public funds. Indeed, the  committee was to scrutinize corruption-related issues (O&apos;Regan  et.al., 2022). 
Since the Public Accountability Committees were established,  many successful initiatives have been made to cope with  fraudulent issues on public funds. In the case of Africa,  improving Public Accountability Committees entails adopting  approaches that address the existing challenges. Considering  the socioeconomic and political issues across many African  countries, effective Public Accountability Committees should; be  independent, foster capacity building, enhance transparency,  strengthen legal frameworks, interact with civil society, utilize  modern technology and enhance cross-border cooperation  (Schoeberlein, 2022). Most of these strategies have served as  the important models for combating corruption in government  institutions across many African countries.  
Many African countries have strengthened their legal  frameworks to fight corruption. For instance, various laws have  been enacted to empower Public Accountability Committees  to function independently and establish penalties for non compliance. Some of the African countries now use modern  technology and have digital platforms for financial reporting,  data collection, and recording and analyses for making  informed decisions and thus have increased transparency  and accountability of the Public Accountability Committees&apos;  work. Further, involvement of citizens in the work of the Public  Accountability Committees have boosted accountability in the  use of government resources.  
For instance, the civil societies in Ghana, Kenya, and Nigeria  participate in monitoring the work of Public Accountability  Committees in relation to addressing key issues such as  corruption (Fatile &amp; Adejuwon, 2023). Regional cooperation  is another model used by some of the African countries that  are members of organizations such as African Union (AU),  and Economic Community of West…………..
