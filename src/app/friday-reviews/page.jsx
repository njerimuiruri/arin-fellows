The paper focuses on the dairy subsector for three reasons: firstly, the dairy subsector is responsible for significant contribution to GHG emissions (Gerssen-Gondelach et al., 2017; Vellinga et al., 2011) and recommending gaps in policy interventions that would promote low emission pathways is significant in climate mitigation. Secondly, the tripod puzzle in developing the dairy subsector requires climate sensitivity, that promote reduced emission, while encouraging increased productivity and livelihood benefits (Lal, 2016). The third reason is the multiple policy implementation levels with interest in low emission dairy development.",
